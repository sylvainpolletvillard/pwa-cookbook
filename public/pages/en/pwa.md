# What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)

_Progressive Web Apps_ or _PWA_ are **websites** that use modern web capabilities to deliver a **native app-like** user experience.

In order to achieve that, PWA must enforce a certain number of technical criterion and performance constraints.

We can also consider PWA as a **seal of quality**. Thus, the term PWA allows to communicate more efficiently with the client about an expected level of quality, instead of a long list of features and obscure technical details.

Like native apps, Progressive Web Apps are:

- **Reliable**: PWA must load instantaneously, independently of network conditions
- **Fast**: the user experience must smooth and animated without any lag
- **Engaging**: the PWA has to behave like a native app and provide to the user a similar feeling

A PWA is mobile-friendly and indexed for SEO just like any modern website. But like apps, PWAs are also installable, available offline, connected to push notifications, and can be tied to location via GPS. In other words, theyâ€™re the best of both worlds.

Many large web companies, such as Google, [communicate a lot](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) about PWA and try to put them in the limelight by [**integrating them more within the platforms**](integration.md), particularly in mobile apps.
