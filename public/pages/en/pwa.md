What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)
============================================

*Progressive Web Apps* or *PWA* are **websites** that use modern web capabilities to deliver a **native app-like** user experience.

In order to achieve that, PWA must enforce a certain number of technical criterion and performance constraints.

We can also consider PWA as a **seal of quality**. Thus, the term PWA allows to communicate more efficiently with the client about an expected level of quality, instead of a long list of features and obscure technical details.

Like native apps, Progressive Web Apps are:

- **Reliable**: PWA must load instantaneously, independently of network conditions
- **Fast**: the user experience must smooth and animated without any lag
- **Engaging**: the PWA has to behave like a native app and provide to the user a similar feeling

Many large web companies, such as Google, [communicate a lot](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) about PWA and try to put them in the limelight by [**integrating them more within the platforms**](integration.md), particularly in mobile apps.
