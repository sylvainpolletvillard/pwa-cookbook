About this cookbook
====================

This website is a *cookbook* that aims to teach you everything you need to know about *Progressive Web Apps (PWA)* : what are PWA, what are their advantages and drawbacks, how to build one...

Since PWA are based on the [progressive enhancement](progressive-enhancement.md) principle, this cookbook also intends to let you learn *progressively* about PWA development.

Every page of this cookbook has a similar structure:

- The **prerequisites** to understand a section are indicated on the top right corder of the page.
- The **table of contents** on the left is used to navigate between pages.
- A **search box** is available on the top right corner of the screen. Type keywords to quickly find the suitable page.

On a final note, **this cookbook itself is a PWA**. Yes, this means you can now read this cookbook while being offline. Also, if your system allows it, you can install this application on your device and get a nice shortcut in your applications panel.
